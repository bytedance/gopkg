## Introduction

`gopkg` is a universal utility collection for Go. It is migrated from the internal code base at ByteDance and is extensively used in production.

We depend on the same code(this repo) in our production environment.

## Releases

`gopkg` recommends users "live-at-head" (update to the latest commit from the main branch as often as possible).
We develop at `develop` branch and will only merge to `main` when `develop` is stable.
