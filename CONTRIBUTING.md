# How to Contribute

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at gopkg@bytedance.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html

## Your First Pull Request
We use github for our codebase. You can start by reading [How To Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Without Semantic Versioning
We keep the stable code in branch `main` like `golang.org/x`. Development base on branch `develop`. And we promise the **Forward Compatibility** by adding new package directory with suffix `v2/v3` when code has break changes.

## Branch Organization
We use [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as our branch organization, as known as [FDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development)


## Bugs
### 1. How to Find Known Issues
We are using [Github Issues](https://github.com/bytedance/gopkg/issues) for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist.

### 2. Reporting New Issues
Providing a reduced test code is a recommended way for reporting issues. Then can placed in:
- Just in issues
- [Golang Playground](https://play.golang.org/)

### 3. Security Bugs
Please do not report the safe disclosure of bugs to public issues. Contact us by [Support Email](mailto:gopkg@bytedance.com)

## Submit a Pull Request
Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:
1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/bytedance/gopkg/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.
2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add. Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.
3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the bytedance/gopkg repo.
4. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:
    ```
    git checkout -b my-fix-branch develop
    ```
5. Create your patch, including appropriate test cases.
6. Follow our [Style Guides](#code-style-guides).
7. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows [AngularJS Git Commit Message Conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit).
   Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
8. Push your branch to GitHub:
    ```
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```
9. In GitHub, send a pull request to `gopkg:develop`

## Contribution Prerequisites
- Our development environment keeps up with [Go Official](https://golang.org/project/).
- You need fully checking with lint tools before submit your pull request. [gofmt](https://golang.org/pkg/cmd/gofmt/) and [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
- You are familiar with [Github](https://github.com) 
- Maybe you need familiar with [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)(our default workflow tool).
